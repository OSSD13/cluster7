# Application Optimization Guide

This document provides instructions on how to optimize the DevPerf application for better performance.

## Optimizations Implemented

The following optimizations have been implemented:

1. **Route Caching**: Routes are now cached for better performance.
2. **Configuration Caching**: Configuration files are cached to reduce file I/O.
3. **View Caching**: Blade views are compiled ahead of time.
4. **Middleware Optimization**: Middleware classes use fully qualified class names.
5. **Security Headers**: Added security headers to all responses.
6. **Redis for Cache and Session**: Configured Redis as the preferred driver for cache and sessions.
7. **Scheduled Optimization**: Added a weekly scheduled task to optimize the application.

## Running Manual Optimizations

To manually optimize the application, run:

```bash
php artisan app:optimize
```

This command will:
- Clear all caches
- Cache configuration
- Cache routes
- Compile views
- Optimize composer autoloader
- Optimize class loader

## Production Deployment Optimizations

When deploying to production, the following steps should be taken:

1. Install dependencies with optimized autoloader:
   ```bash
   composer install --optimize-autoloader --no-dev
   ```

2. Run the optimization command:
   ```bash
   php artisan app:optimize
   ```

3. Ensure Redis is properly configured in your production environment.

4. Set appropriate environment variables:
   ```
   APP_ENV=production
   APP_DEBUG=false
   CACHE_STORE=redis
   SESSION_DRIVER=redis
   QUEUE_CONNECTION=redis
   ```

## Front-end Optimizations

1. Build assets for production:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. Enable content compression on your web server.

3. Utilize a CDN for serving static assets.

## Database Optimizations

1. Ensure proper indexes are in place for frequently queried columns.
2. Consider adding Redis caching for frequent database queries.
3. Run `ANALYZE TABLE` on MySQL/PostgreSQL periodically to update statistics.

## Monitoring

Regularly monitor application performance with tools like:
- Laravel Telescope (development)
- Laravel Horizon (for queue monitoring)
- New Relic
- Blackfire.io

## Regular Maintenance

1. Keep dependencies up to date.
2. Periodically clean old log files.
3. Prune old records from database where appropriate.
4. Monitor queue performance and adjust worker count as needed.
